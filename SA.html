<p>The Service Art series was a multi-year participatory public art project between 2011 and 2014. Service artists, equipped with assistive contraptions, would offer anticlimatic services to pedestrian-viewer-clients. These encounters were framed in an art context through conversation. Service artists encouraged aesthetic readings of the situation and the viewer's participation. The series aimed to critically examine the politics of public space, art accessibility, participation as a mechanism for exchange, and the implications of a growing global service economy. Every project in this series was conceived and organized, and every contraption fabricated by myself. Friends were recruited to perform the role of service artist in our deployments. </p>
